# WebsocketJoystick

You may like playing Euro Truck Simulator, but you may not afford a steering wheel. I was not rich at that time, either. 
So I wrote this app to turn a mobile phone into a general steering wheel for gaming.

# Installation

This repo is not meant to be that "clean", instead, it should be very friendly to you! 
Don't worry about `npm install` or if you live in some restricted area, your network may be even more frustrating.
Everything is ready-to-use once you downloaded this repo as zip.

Firstly, install `nodejs` with `node-v14.15.4-x64.msi`.

Secondly, install `vjoy` with `vJoySetup.exe`.

# Playing

Now, you are almost ready to play.

Open a "batch" window at where you place these files by holding shift while right click the blank area, like this:

A PICTURE

and then type:

```
node app.js|python backend.py
```
